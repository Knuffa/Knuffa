üëã Hello, I‚Äôm @Knuffa

I strive to align technology with human interests.

I want to contribute toward a future where technologists are mindful of their chosen social impact. 

Additionally, I‚Äôm interested in responsible AI and hope to position myself as someone who, later in their career, does more hands-on work to help technologists with adhering to responsible AI practices. 
(For example, I‚Äôd like to explore what guidelines would help technologists design recommender systems that serves users first, placing a lower priority on maintaining engagement.) Toward my aspirations, at my current career juncture as a software engineer, I'm consciously furthering both my technical and communication/leadership ability.

Prior to joining Microsoft, I was working toward a PhD in Information at the University of Michigan (and have since become part of the infamous ‚Äú50% of doctoral students drop out‚Äù statistic!). Before my graduate program, I graduated from the College of William & Mary with a Bachelor of Science double-majoring in Computer Science and Applied Statistics.
